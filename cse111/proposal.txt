CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

1. What is the title of your program?
The title of my program is "Word Frequency Counter". 

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
The purpose of my program is analize text data by counting the frequency of each word in any text file. 
This can be helpful in many different real world problems.
Some examples are: detecting plagiarism or similarity in academic or professional documents, analyzing customer feedback to identify common themes or concerns and, many others.
By counting word frequencies this program will provide support decision-making processes in various different important problems.  

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
From developing this program I will have the opportunity to read text files in Python, use strings and manipulate text data, 
implementing dictionaries, reausable functions, writing test functions through pystest... I still planning and thinking about the project I will try to implement as much resources from my learning as possible. 

4. What Python modules will your program use?
The program will primarily utilize the following Python modules:
os: To interact with the operating system and handle file operations.
re: For regular expression matching and text manipulation if required.
collections: To utilize the Counter class for efficient word counting.
pytest: To write and execute test functions for various program functions.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes, I will separate the Python program into functions that perform single tasks. 
By following the modular design approach, I will create reusable functions that accept parameters and return results. 
This design will enhance code readability, maintainability, and testability. 
While some functions may involve user input and printing results, the majority of functions will be designed for reusability and ease of testing.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?
6.	Absolutely, I will write test functions to test at least two of the program functions. 
By employing the pytest framework, I will be able to write comprehensive tests that verify the correctness of individual functions. 
The tests will cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the program functions as intended. 
The test functions will help identify and resolve any issues or bugs in the code, ensuring the program's reliability and accuracy.
