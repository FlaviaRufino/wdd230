----------  ----------  -------------------------
2021-12-02      1.5     b. Researching by reading articles and watching applicable videos
2023-07-17     20 m     c. Designed the structure of the program using flowcharts
2023-07-18       1      d. Wrote experimental code to count words in a text file
2023-07-19       1      d. Wrote code for the main program functions
2023-07-20    30 m      e. Wrote test functions to verify the correctness of program functions
2023-07-21    30 m      f. Debugged and fixed issues in the program

2. Write the names of the functions in your program.
Functions in My Program:
count_words()
read_file()
remove_punctuation()
calculate_word_frequency()
display_word_frequency()
main()

3. Answer the following questions about the functions in your program.
    a. Does each function perform a single task?
Yes, each function in my program performs a single task. For example, the count_words() function counts the number of words, the read_file() function reads a file, the remove_punctuation() function removes punctuation from text, the calculate_word_frequency() function calculates the frequency of words, and the display_word_frequency() function displays the word frequency.

    b. Does the name of each function describe or convey the task?
Yes, the name of each function in my program describes or conveys its task. For example, the count_words() function conveys that it counts the number of words, the read_file() function indicates that it reads a file, the remove_punctuation() function suggests that it removes punctuation from text, the calculate_word_frequency() function implies that it calculates the frequency of words, and the display_word_frequency() function indicates that it displays the word frequency. The function names provide clear and concise information about what each function does in the program.

    c. Do most of your program functions have parameters and return a result?
Yes, most of my program functions have parameters and return a result. For example, the count_words() function takes a text parameter and returns the word count, the read_file() function takes a file name parameter and returns the file contents, and so on.

4. Write the names of the test functions that you wrote to test your
program functions.
Test Functions for the program: 
test_count_words()
test_read_file()
test_remove_punctuation()
test_calculate_word_frequency()
test_display_word_frequency()
