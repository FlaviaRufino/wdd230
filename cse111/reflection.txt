Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
Functions are really powerful and in my opinion they keep the program well organized and reusable. 
One example when I could see that was in the last project of this block because once a function is defined, it can be used multiple times throughout the program or even in other programs. 
For instance, the calculate_word_frequency function can be used in different projects that require word frequency analysis without having to rewrite the logic each time.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Testing functions are very important, it really shows if our functions are readable, organized and working well. 
Testing functions is the best way to ensure your program is working well and it is easy to understand. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
My process starts by indetifying the problem, cheking and reasearching for more information to correct it and after 
check Inputs and Outputs: Verify that the inputs to the problematic code are correct and that the outputs match your expectations. Incorrect inputs or outputs could be a sign of a logical error.
